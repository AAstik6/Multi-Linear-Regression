# Multi-Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression** using Python and a real-world economic dataset.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `multi-linear-regression.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter notebook with the full model and analysis
- `economic_index.csv` â€“ Dataset used for regression analysis

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repo
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code
3. Run cells step-by-step to see how multiple linear regression is implemented

## ðŸ“Š Output

The notebook includes:
- Data visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Model training with `sklearn.linear_model`
- Model evaluation using RÂ² and MSE
